# Automation Made Simple: Getting Started with n8n

If you’ve ever wanted to automate repetitive tasks like sending emails, moving files between apps, or tracking data, n8n is a tool designed just for that. Even if you’re not a developer, you can set up complex workflows in minutes.

## What Is n8n?

n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool. Think of it as a bridge between your apps and services, allowing them to work together automatically.

Instead of manually copying data or performing repetitive tasks, n8n lets you connect apps and define workflows visually.

For example:
- Automatically save Gmail attachments to Google Drive
- Notify Slack when a new Trello card is created
- Sync new Shopify orders with your CRM

And the best part? You can do all of this without writing a single line of code—though if you know JavaScript, you can extend its capabilities even further.

## How n8n Works

n8n uses a node-based system:
- **Nodes** – Each app or action is a node. For example, Gmail, Slack, or Google Sheets.
- **Triggers** – Nodes that start a workflow. Example: “When a new email arrives in Gmail…”
- **Actions** – Nodes that perform tasks. Example: “Create a row in Google Sheets”.
- **Connections** – Nodes are connected to define the workflow sequence.

Example workflow:
- **Trigger**: Receive a new email in Gmail
- **Action**: Extract attachment
- **Action**: Save attachment to Dropbox
- **Action**: Notify team on Slack

This workflow now runs automatically every time a new email arrives. No manual intervention required.

## Why Use n8n?

1. **Saves Time**  
   Stop wasting hours on repetitive tasks. Automate emails, data syncing, and notifications.
2. **No-Code Friendly**  
   You don’t need to be a programmer. Drag, drop, and connect nodes visually.
3. **Customizable**  
   For developers, n8n supports custom JavaScript code for advanced workflows.
4. **Open-Source & Flexible**  
   Unlike some automation tools, n8n is open-source. You can self-host it, ensuring full control over your data.
