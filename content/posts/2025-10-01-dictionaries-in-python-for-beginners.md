Dictionaries in Python are a powerful way to store and organize data using key-value pairs.

### ðŸ”‘ What is a Dictionary?
A dictionary is a collection of items where each item has a **key** and a **value**.  
Think of it like a real phonebook â€” the personâ€™s name is the key, and their phone number is the value.

### ðŸ“– Example: Phonebook
```python
# Creating a dictionary
phonebook = {
    "Alice": "123-4567",
    "Bob": "987-6543"
}

# Accessing values
print(phonebook["Alice"])  # Output: 123-4567

# Adding a new entry
phonebook["Charlie"] = "555-1234"

# Updating a value
phonebook["Alice"] = "111-2222"

# Deleting an entry
del phonebook["Bob"]

print(phonebook)
